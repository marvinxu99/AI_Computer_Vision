Run Jupyter Notebooks in the same venv

If your book includes .ipynb notebooks and you want to execute them interactively:

Install JupyterLab or Notebook inside your venv
    pip install notebook


Then launch:

    jupyter notebook


or

    jupyter lab


This ensures your book’s kernels and dependencies all match the same virtual environment.


To include your venv as a selectable Jupyter kernel:

    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (venv)"


You can now open notebooks from VS Code, JupyterLab, or your book build, and they’ll all use your virtual environment’s Python.
